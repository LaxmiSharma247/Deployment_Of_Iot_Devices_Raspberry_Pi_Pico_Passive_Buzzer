#### Application - Raspberry Pi Pico Passive Buzzer (picozero)

#### Objective - To test a passive buzzer to play an alarm sound at one second interval.
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board that can be programmed using MicroPython or C/C++.
Here's a basic outline of the steps you can follow:

#### Hardware Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Passive Buzzer
* Jumper wires
#### Wiring:
Connect one leg of the passive buzzer to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi Pico (let's say GPIO Pin 14) and the other leg to the ground (GND) pin.

#### Software/Programming Steps:
1. Set Up Your Raspberry Pi Pico:
Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Install the MicroPython Firmware:
Follow the instructions in the official MicroPython Raspberry Pi Pico documentation to install MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Write the MicroPython Code:
4. Upload and Run the Code:
Make sure your Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to your computer.
Click the "Run" button in Thonny to upload and run the code on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
Project Execution:
Once the code is uploaded and running, the passive buzzer will produce an alarm sound at one-second intervals.

Feel free to adjust the sleep durations in the code to change the frequency and duration of the alarm sound. Additionally, we can customize the code to add more features or complexity based on your preferences.
